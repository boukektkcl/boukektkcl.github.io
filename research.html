                    <p class="publication-title">Generative AI and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from the United Kingdom</p>
                    <p class="publication-authors">Bouke Klein Teeselink</p>
                    <p class="publication-abstract">This paper uses a difference-in-differences design comparing outcomes across firms and occupations from 2021 to 2025. Results show that highly exposed firms reduce employment, particularly in junior positions, and sharply curtail new hiring, with technical roles (software engineers, data analysts) experiencing the steepest declines. At the occupation level, roles more exposed to LLMs show substantial reductions in job listings and posted salaries.</p>

                    <p class="publication-authors">with Georgios Melios</p>
                    <p class="publication-abstract">This paper provides causal evidence on the impact of religious identification on political preferences, gender norms, societal beliefs, and group behavior. Exploiting clergy sexual abuse scandals as exogenous variation in Catholicism, we demonstrate that religious de-identification leads to significant shifts in individual attitudes and political alignment.</p>
